This is an inofficial online adaption of the DSM-5 Cross-Cutting Symptoms Screening Questionnaire. 
The original version by the American Psychiatric Association can be found on the [APA resources website](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/educational-resources/assessment-measures) and is available as print version [PDF](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Level-1-Measure-Adult.pdf).
### Introduction

The DSM-5 CC Symptoms measure is designed to be an highly efficient screening instrument. It consists of 23 items loading on 13 domains: *Depression, Anger, Mania, Anxiety, Somatic Symptoms, Suicidal Ideation, Psychosis, Sleep Problems, Memory, Repetitive Thoughts and Behaviors, Dissociation, Personality Functioning, Substance Use*. The DSM-5 CC Symptoms provides thresholds along with recommendations for further Level-2 inquiry. 



This online adaption provides automatized results feedback. Data is only used to validate and normate the questionnaire and no personal-sensible information is assessed.

### Further Development


The online adaption of the DSM-5 CC Symptoms was created, based on a [comparison of the efficiency of current clinical questionnaires](https://github.com/UN-Questionnaire/Comparison-of-Psychological-Clinical-Instruments). 

The *UN-Q  Ultraefficient-Neuroscientific Questionnaire* is a general screening instrument that has been strongly influenced by the DSM-5 CC Symptoms. The online adaption of the UN-Q offers a broader assessment and more advanced retesting possibilities and is available in [English](https://github.com/UN-Questionnaire/UN-Questionnaire-en) and [German](https://github.com/UN-Questionnaire/UN-Questionnaire-de)




## Dependencies

Created with formR. FormR is a software framework based on R for the creation of psychological questionnaires. It was developed by Ruben Arslan at the University Oldenburg and is under active development, therefor it can sometimes not be available during software changes. It is an incredibly conscientious and dedicated project that made this project even possible. (Arslan, Walther & Tata, 2020)[1]
